freestylesNuclearBlast_fnc_staticRadiation

Apply radiation damage to units which enter blast area after wards.


Arguments:

0 - positionASL, blast origin position
1 - number, inner radius, extreme radiation (e.g. close to crater)
2 - number, outer radius for the radiation to occur
3 - number, intervall at which area is checked for units
4 - number, duration over which radiation damage is applied
5 - number, damage applied in inner radius per intervall
6 - number, damage applied in outer radius per intervall
7 - number, amount of times area is checked, total duration is this time intervall
*/
