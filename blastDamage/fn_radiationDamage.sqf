freestylesNuclearBlast_fnc_radiationDamage

Apply radiation damage to units in blast area. Includes nuclear radioation and thermal.
Amount of damage depends on zones for each category, damage between categores can add up.


Arguments:

0 - positionASL, blast origin position
1 - number, radius for 5000 rem radiation (lethal within days)
2 - number, radius for 500 rem radiation (likely lethal within 1 month)
3 - number, radius for guaranteed 3rd degree burns
4 - number, radius for 50% chance of 3rd degree burns
5 - number, time in which radiation damage is applied
